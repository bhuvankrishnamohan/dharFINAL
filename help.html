            </h2>
            <p class="mission-text">
                At <strong>Dogs Help and Rescue (DHAR)</strong>, our mission is to raise awareness about the cruel practice of puppy mills and advocate for the well-being of dogs who suffer in these inhumane conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
                <strong>Puppy mills</strong> are commercial breeding operations that prioritize profit over the health and welfare of animals. These facilities often house dogs in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions without access to proper veterinary care, socialization, or a safe living environment.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
                Our goal is to <strong>educate the public</strong> about the harsh realities of puppy mills and promote responsible pet ownership. We strive to provide rescue and rehabilitation to dogs rescued from these mills, offering them a second chance at a loving, healthy life.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
                With the support of compassionate individuals like you, we are working to <strong>end the cycle of cruelty</strong> and give every dog the chance to live a life of happiness and freedom. <em>Together, we can make a difference.</em>
            </p>

                    <p class="point-description">
                        We encourage you to adopt puppies from animal shelters instead of purchasing dogs from breeders or pet stores. Shelters are filled with loving animals waiting for a forever home, and adopting helps reduce the demand for puppy mills.

                        Many animal shelters are forced to euthanize dogs due to lack of capacity and funding. Your support will help fund organizations like the U.S. Humane Society and the ASPCA, enabling them to save more lives and provide proper care.

                        Puppy mills are horrific breeding operations that prioritize profit over animal welfare. Dogs in these mills endure severe abuse and neglect. By spreading awareness, we can stop the cycle of cruelty and prevent future generations from suffering.
